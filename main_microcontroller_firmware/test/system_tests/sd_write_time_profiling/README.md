# Test to profile the time spent on decimation filtering and SD card writing

## Brief
- This test reads a csv file and generates a histogram of the times represented in the csv
- The csv is created by the MAX32666 microcontroller and written to the SD card
- The csv has one row per sample-rate/bit-depth combo
- Each row has one cell per filter/SD-write block

## Prereqs
- python, pandas, matplotlib

## To generate the histogram plot
