 * @brief `decimation_filter_downsample(s, d, n)` downsamples `n` samples from source buffer `s` and stores the result

 *
 * @pre `decimation_filter_set_sample_rate(sr)` has been called with the desired sample rate `sr`
 *
 * @param src_384kHz the source buffer to downsample. It is expected that this is the 384kHz buffer with little-endian
 * q31 samples. Must be at least as long as `num_samps_to_filter`
 *
 * @param dest the destination buffer for the downsampled data. Must be long enough to hold the downsampled data. The
 * size needed for the destination buffer is given by `num_samps_to_filter * (sr / 384e3)` where `sr` is the previously
 * set sample rate.
 *
 * @param num_samps_to_filter the number of samples from `src` to decimate and store in `dest`. This must be a multiple
 * of 16.
 *
 * @post the source buffer is downsampled and stored in the destination buffer.
 *
 * @retval the length of the downsampled destination buffer in samples, this will be an integer multiple of
 * `num_samps_to_filter` given by `num_samps_to_filter * (sr / 384e3)` if all preconditions are met.
