/**
 * @file    wav_header.h
 * @brief   A software module for generating WAVE file headers is represented here.
 * @details WAVE is a specific format for writing audio files. WAVE headers contain information about the audio sample
 * rate, bit depth, file size, and other metadata.
 *
 * We can configure WAVE headers with 4 pieces of information:
 * - Mono/stereo
 * - Bits per sample
 * - Sample rate
 * - Total file length
 *
 * Other internal fields can be derived from the above 4 numbers.
 *
 * The file length field is the total size of the entire file, and includes the size of the header itself.
 * Because of this, it is common to write a file like this:
 * 1) open a new file for writing
 * 2) advance the write pointer by the size of the wave header so the audio data starts right after the header
 * 3) write all the audio data
 * 4) save the size of the file into the file_length field of a Wave_Header_Attributes_t variable
 *      a) the size we just saved includes both the audio data and the (currently blank) header
 * 5) reset the write pointer back to the top of the file
 * 6) use the Wave_Header_Attributes_t variable to set the wave attributes, including the total file size just set
 * 7) write the wave header
 * 8) close the file
 *
 * In code it would look something like this (psuedocode, some args omitted for clarity):
 * 1) f_open(my_file_name);
 * 2) f_lseek(wav_header_get_header_length());
 * 3) f_write(audio_buffer, audio_buffer_size);
 *    ... potentially more rounds of writing audio data to the SD card
 * 4) wav_attributes.file_length = f_size();
 * 5) f_lseek(0);
 * 6) wav_header_set_attributes(&wav_attributes);
 * 7) f_write(wav_header_get_header(), wav_header_get_header_length());
 * 8) f_close();
 *
 * The other wave header attributes may be set at the same time as the total file length, or set at an earlier time.
