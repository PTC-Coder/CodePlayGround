 * `data_converters_i24_swap_endianness(s, d, l)` stores 24 bit samples in `s` into `d` with the ms and ls bytes swapped
 *
 * @param src the buffer of packed 24 bit samples to swap endianness of, must be at least `l` bytes long
 *
 * @param dest the destination buffer for the packed 24 bit samples, must be at least as long as `src`
 *
 * @param src_len_in_bytes the length in bytes of the source buffer, must be a multiple of 12 (the smallest valid chunk
 * size in bytes for i24 samples)
 *
 * @post the 24 bit samples in `s` are stored in `d` with their most significant byte and least significant byte swapped
 *
 * Example:
 * The below diagram shows four 24 bit samples packed into three 32 bit words. This is the smallest valid chunk size.
 * Before swapping the samples have their ms bytes first, then mid byte, then ls byte. After swapping the order from
 * right to left is ms byte, mid byte, ls byte.
